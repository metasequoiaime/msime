"""Every source under platforms/macos/src must be compiled by some target, or say out loud that it is not.

#912 reported that the macOS input method hands English keys to the application in Chinese mode, found a
hardcoded engine resource path in src/dictionary/DictionaryRuntime.mm, fixed it there, passed review and
changed nothing: no target compiles that file. The shipping bundle uses src/core/ClientDictionaryRuntime.mm.
A CMake comment already said so, 750 lines away from the edit, and it was not enough.

A file that nothing builds is not automatically wrong - this platform keeps adapters from the pinned Apple
snapshot for reference. What is wrong is finding that out after shipping a fix into one. So each of them is
listed here with the file that replaced it, and has to carry the marker below near the top, where the next
person to edit it is already looking. A new orphan fails until it is either built or listed.

Compiled means named as a source in platforms/macos/CMakeLists.txt with comments stripped, because the
mention that misled #912 was itself a comment.
